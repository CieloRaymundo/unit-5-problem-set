# DOM Assessment

### Directions
1. Fork and clone this lab

**For Short Responses:**

1. Write your responses directly in the `short-response.md` file. **Be sure to format your responses and code snippets correctly using Markdown.** As you commit and push changes, you will see your rendered markdown on GitHub.

2. When you are done with both sections. Push your final commits and open a PR.

**For Coding Exercises:**

3. Navigate to the `exercises` directory to complete the coding exercises.
4. Run `npm install` to load project dependencies.
5. Complete coding exercises in the `exercises.js` file.
6. Test your code often by running `npm test`.
7. Check for style by running `./node_modules/.bin/eslint exercises.js` in the terminal.

   **Note:** You are not done with your exercises until all tests pass and there are no eslint errors.


### Tips
* This is open book, open note, open documentation, open console. Use your resources. Just don't use your neighbor. ðŸ˜‰
* Pay close attention to your spelling and grammar. For short responses, if you want to take advantage of spell check, etc., you can always type in a word document first and then copy your responses over.
* I'm looking for clarity and conciseness. Answer the questions as directly as you possibly can, in as few words as you possibly can, while using as precise of language as you possibly can.
* Lastly, I'm on Slack if you have any questions. ðŸ¤“
